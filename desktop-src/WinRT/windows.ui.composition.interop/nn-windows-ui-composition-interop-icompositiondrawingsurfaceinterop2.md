## Description

A native interoperation interface that allows you to read back the contents of a composition drawing surface (or a composition virtual drawing surface). This interface is available in C++ only.

**ICompositionDrawingSurfaceInterop2** inherits from the [ICompositionDrawingSurfaceInterop](/windows/win32/api/windows.ui.composition.interop/nn-windows-ui-composition-interop-icompositiondrawingsurfaceinterop) interface.

## Remarks

> [!NOTE]
> This interface is available on Windows 10, version 1903 (10.0; Build 18362), but it is not defined in the `windows.ui.composition.interop.h` header file for that version of the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK). If you first obtain a pointer to an [ICompositionDrawingSurfaceInterop](/windows/win32/api/windows.ui.composition.interop/nn-windows-ui-composition-interop-icompositiondrawingsurfaceinterop) interface, you can then query that (via [QueryInterface](/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(refiid_void))) for a pointer to an **ICompositionDrawingSurfaceInterop2** interface.
